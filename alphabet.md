# General

- Default mode of Vim editor is `Command/Normal Mode`.
  - Every key on keyboard is a command or macro (movement).
- Hitting `a`, `i`, or `o`, puts us into `Insert Mode`.
  - Entering insert mode with `a` places text after the cursor.
  - Entering insert mode with `i` places text before the cursor.
- `Esc` to exit `Insert Mode` back into `Command/Normal Mode`.
- `$` to jump to the end.
- Use `:set number` to include line numbers and `:set nonumber` to turn line numbers off.

# Quit

    How to QUIT, etcetera.

## :q

- `:q` to "quit".

## :q!

- `q!` required to assert that we want to "quit" without saving (writing) any changes.
- `ZQ` is the same as `:q!`.

## :wq

- `:wq` to "write" and "quit".
- `ZZ` is the same as `:wq`.

## :x

- Like `:wq` but only "write" if changes have been made.
- `ZZ` is the same as `:x`.

## :help

- Alternatively `:h` for shorthand.
- For on-line help.

## :e

- `:e filename` edits a file in a new buffer.

# A

    APPEND text.

- One of the three ways to insert into a document.

## a

- Append means to add after.
- Entering insert mode with lowercase `a` places text after the cursor once in `Insert Mode`.

## A

- Shift `A` appends to the end of a line.

# B

    Move BACK by words.

## b

- Lowercase `b` in `Command/Normal Mode` will move to:
  - The first character of the previous word.
  - To a special character if present.
- Does not consider `_` a special character.
- Considers `-` a special character.

## B

- Shift `B` in `Command/Normal Mode` will skip special characters and only move by word.
- Ignores both `_` and `-`.

## [count]

- Takes a number `[count]` as a prefix to either `b` or `B` to move `[count]` number of words.

# C

    CHANGE text.

> Note `["x]` in the documentation, this indicates a buffer which stores the removed text to be pasted later with `P` if desired.

- Essentially a deleting and insert, in other words, a "change".

## c

- `Command/Normal Mode` command.
- Requires a direction.
- Once a direction is selected, it will delete in that direction and enter `Insert Mode`.
  - `LEFT/RIGHT`:
    - Deletes a character.
  - `UP/DOWN`:
    - Deletes current like and entire line above or below.
- Can be combined with other commands such as `b`.
  - Lowercase `cb` would delete to the beginning of the previous word and then enter `Insert Mode`.

## cc

- Lowercase `cc` deletes entirety of the current line regardless of where you are in the line and then enters `Insert Mode`.

## vc

- Visual selection, allows you to select chunk of text to delete and then enter `Insert Mode`.

## C

- Shift `C` deletes the remainder of the line from whereever the cursor is on the line and then enters `Insert Mode`.

# D

    DELETE.

> Note `["x]` in the documentation, this indicates a buffer which stores the removed text to be pasted later with `P` if desired.

> Another Note is that a "line" is determined by line breaks, not periods and sentences.

- `Command/Normal Mode` command.

## d

- Like `c`, requires a direction.
 Once a direction is selected, it will delete in that direction and enter `Insert Mode`.
  - `LEFT/RIGHT`:
    - Deletes a character.
  - `UP/DOWN`:
    - Deletes current like and entire line above or below.
- Very similar to `c` with the distinction that `c` leaves you in `Insert Mode` and `d` leaves you in `Command/Normal Mode`.

## dd

- Lowercase `dd` deletes entirety of the current line regardless of where you are in the line and leaves you in `Command/Normal Mode`.

## vd

- Visual selection, allows you to select chunk of text to delete and leaves you in `Command/Normal Mode`.

## D

- Shift `D` deletes the remainder of the line from whereever the cursor is on the line and leaves you in `Command/Normal Mode`.
  - A perk of this is that you can hit `u` to undo without having to `Esc` back into `Command/Normal Mode` like you would for shift `C`.

# E

    Move to the END of words.

- `Command/Normal Mode` command.

## e

- Lowercase `e` will move to:
  - The end of the current word if it is in the middle of the current word.
  - The end of the next word.
- Does not honor special characters as part of the word, ignores them.

## E

- Shift `E` will behave similarly to lowercase `e` but it will honor special characters as part of the word.

## [count]

- Takes a number `[count]` as a prefix to either `e` or `E` to move to the end of `[count]` number of words.

# F

    Move to FILL cursor with specified character.

- `Command/Normal Mode` command.

## f

- Lowercase `f` followed by the specified character to fill cursor with in forwards direction.

## F

- Shift `F` followed by the specified character to fill the cursor with in backwards direction.

## [count]

- Takes a number `[count]` as a prefix to either `f` or `F` to fill cursor with `[count]` number of a specified character.

# G

    GO to line (and other stuff, in other words GENERAL).

- Junk drawer of Vim (a lot you can do with it).
- Can be used as a general purpose modifier or prefix for other commands.

## gg

- Lowercase `gg` will take you to the first line in the document.

## gv

- Lowercase `gv` reselects the most recent visual selection. 

## G

- Shift `G` will take you to the last line in the document.

## [count]

- Shift `G` preceded by a `[count]` will go to that line number.

## :[count]

- A `:` followed by the line number, is shorthand to move the cursor to that line.
  - Example `:25` would move the cursor to line 25.

# HJKL

    Moving LEFT, DOWN, UP, RIGHT.

## h

## I

- Shift `I` enters `Insert Mode` at first character of current line.

## [count]

- Precede `i` with some `[count]` value so that when `Insert Mode` is exited, the inserted text repeats `[count]` number of times.

# M

    MARK buffers.

## m

- Lowercase `m` followed by any alphabetic character sets a mark.

## :marks

- Marks can be made visible using `:marks`.

## `

- Backtick `` ` `` followed by the alphabetic character associate with a mark will take us back to that mark.

## '

- Singlequote `'` followed by the alphabetic character associated with a mark will take us back to the start of the line that has the mark on it.

## :delmark

- Use `:delmark` followed by alphabetic character to delete that designated marker.

## :delm

- Shorthand for `:delmark`.

## :delm!

- Delete all markers using `:delm!`.

## m<>

- Use `m<` and `m>` to contain some text in the document to select and manipulate later using something like `gv`.

## M

# N

    NEXT result in search.

## /

## W

- Shift `W` takes cursor to the beginning of the next word and does not consider special characters.
